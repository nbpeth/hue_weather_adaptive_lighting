# Phillips Hue color weather adaptive lighting

***

A Simple node.js function that changes the state of Phillips Hue lights based on current weather conditions.

Purpose: To set brightness, warmth, saturation and color to compliment current weather conditions. 

For example, internal lighting on a bright and sunny day might be whiter, to match the temperature of the lighting outside, and dimmer to accentuate the sunlight without drowning out natural light.
